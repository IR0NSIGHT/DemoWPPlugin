# Frosted Peaks
This is a hello-world project for me to learn how to create plugins for WorldPainter.

## Usage

The plugin adds a new tool/operation: FrostedPeaks  
Apply smooth frost layer globally to Mountain Peaks

- Select the tool with the Forst symbol + mountain peak
- set 'at or above' to 120
- set 'at or below' to 170
- left click anywhere on the map
- The tool will fill everywhere with frost
   - starting at 0% strength at level 120, 
   - reaching 100% strength at level 170
   - smoothly transitioning inbetween
- The tool allows the 'inside selection' filter too
- Other filters are ignored

- gridpanel has wierd collisions on x axis with oter points when dragging
- selected point is not properly updated from table -> grid panel

- zoom feature for grid panel
- order values alpabetically for discrete MappingValues
- order in global list display
- search for any type in global list
- mismatch: after changing name of mapping, the macro editor does not update the names.
- bug: mapping editor only updated on second selection of mapping from global list
- investigate: sometimes saveing/loading doesnt seem  to work?
